					- The group had to skip a video chat meeting due to technological issues beyond the groupâ€™s control (i.e. a service-wide outage where Microsoft Teams, Outlook etc. was inaccessible to many of our members).<br><br>
					- The group still spoke some a little bit via text chat, through the mobile MS Teams application as well on Google Documents, where we could better prepare for our consultation with Anthony on Thursday, where we delegated some work for
					everyone to do.

				<h2>Github activity log commentary for Assignment 2</h2>
				<p>The group's activity log reflects quite accurately how the group completed their sections. Given that Belle was the person who was assigned to do more of the organisational aspects
					of the assessments (the Tools section), she was the first to make a start on the website, setting up both the repository and the website layout that the other members could add their information
					to at their own leisure.
					<br><br> The other members added in information at varying times, with a big bulk of the content being added nearer to submission date due to conflicting and other responsibilities and deadlines
					in other studies and in their personal lives, as well as some sections having to be changed after feedback was received for Assignment 1.
					<br><br>Tom and Ben, both of whom started quite early due to getting started and completing their sections ahead of time, started adding their content in early. Given that the project idea was changed
					a week or so before the submission date, Tung could only add in his content once the group could determine which project idea to do.
					<br><br>Andrew and Campbell elected to place their content into the report first before placing it on the website. Belle can be seen throughout the activity log as she fixes formatting mistakes,
					adding her own content onto the website, and last minute additions and edits to the website.</p>

				<h2>Github activity log commentary for Assignment 3</h2>
				<p>The group's activity log reflects quite accurately how the group progressed throughout the project. Given that there was a lot of other moving parts that needed to be accomplished before we could even consider
					adding more content to our website, a majority of content uploading onto the new repository was done closer to the due date, when all of the written parts were mostly completed, which we could prioritise with
					the peace of mind that the prototypes and artefacts to showcase were completed. Tom hosted the forked repository and began uploading proof-read content, and the other members followed suit, uploading content where they could.
					<br><br>This assessment also came when there were other assessments that needed to be completed, along with other commitments in our members' lives.
					As such, commits were relatively sporadic, mostly done in large chunks closer to submission date.</p>
