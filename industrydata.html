				<p> <b>Top IT Job Titles (Feb 2018)</b> </p>

				<p>Based on a research study by Burning Glass Technologies, we were able to rank the job titles based on their information gathered from the US population. Although this was a US study, their global trends usually have high similarity to the
					Australian economy.<br>
					<br>From the job roles studied, they broke them down to the following 5 categories; flagship jobs, fast-growing jobs, high-growth jobs, modest-growth jobs and declining jobs.
					The study had also broken down all jobs into 7 groups: </p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Business</li>
					<li>Construction and Transportation</li>
					<li>Digital</li>
					<li>Health Care</li>
					<li>Science, engineering, and manufacturing</li>
					<li>Social services, personal services, and education</li>
					<li>Other</li>
				</ul>
				The majority of the group’s ideal jobs would be placed in the digital group. Although not the exact ideal jobs being advertised, the digital group has quite a high demand in online job postings, similarly to business jobs which is relevant
				for Andrew.
				<br><br>Using data gathered from Burning Glass Technologies’ Job Title (February 2018), a developer programmer has a significantly higher amount of postings compared to the rest of the jobs available. The group’s ideal jobs are also in the
				field of systems engineer which is also high in demand. There are also help desk officers included in the study, however do not have as much demand as the others.
				<br><br>In regards to Andrew’s ideal job of a tax accountant, demand has been stable and does not seem to be trending downwards, this is due to
				the fact that there will always be taxes and assistance in that field will be required. As for the digital industry, it is expected
				that the demand of their jobs will continue to grow as technology advances.</p>

				<p> <b>Top IT Skills (March 2018)</b> </p>

				</br>
				<p>Although our jobs will require information technology, our jobs are not dependent on the highest three skill sets - SQL, Javascript, and Java. The IT specific skills required involve many from Microsoft Windows onwards (based on March 2018).
					<br><br>As per our group’s IT skills, we have experience or working on the experience of what is required and could soon have many more IT required skills. The skills required for our ideal job industries do revolve around some more specific IT requirements, however we expect to learn these skills on the way.</p>

				</br>


				<h2> Group Generic Skills </h2>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li> Fluent English research, analysis and writing skills; capacity to read and analyse reports in French is an advantage;</li>
					<li> Ability to work within (and support) multi located business user base </li>
					<li> Demonstrated ability to think laterally and strategically networking experience </li>
					<li> Strong customer relation skills, online advertising </li>
					<li> Able to work in a team environment with strong communications skills </li>
					<li> Understanding of market trends and the ability to work with strong analytical and time management skills </li>
				</ul>
				<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images\Generic Skills.JPG" alt="" data-position="top center" /></a>
				<p> <b>Top Generic Skills (March 2018)</b> </p>

				<p>Given that general skills can be applicable to any industry, it's important that members of our group appreciate how crucial it is to keep building a repertoire of sought-after skills that help them stand out in the job market.
				<br><br>The most important general skill in demand is communication. This is followed by other general skills from problem-solving to organisation. The group so far has shown great communication skills, which should reflect greatly on the team's job prospects.
			<br><br>As opposed to IT specific skills, general skills were required for all of our ideal jobs, as these skills will reflect on how well we work with others and how well we will be able to manage ourselves in the office and beyond. For example, all jobs will require some form of good communication, but not all will require SQL skills.
		<br><br>There were a few highly ranked skills from the Burning Glass data that was not within the general skills that was listed as an explicit requirement for an ideal job posting:</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Troubleshooting</li>
					<li>Planning</li>
					<li>Detail oriented</li>
				</ul>
				</br>

				<h2> Has Our Ideal Job Changed? </h2>
				<p><b>Andrew:</b> Although interesting to me, I am not seeking a job in the IT industry. The general skills were quite appealing to me as those were more relevant. I always knew how important those skills were but not to that extent. Ultimately my ideal job remains the same.</p>
				<p><b>Belle:</b> My ideal job hasn't really changed! It looks like the job title and skills relevant to my ideal job rank quite highly, which is a bonus given that it's also within the legal sphere! Seeing SQL’s prevalence in the data, however, does make me consider whether it'd be beneficial to work with databases.</p>
				<p><b>Ben:</b> Taking a look at the data, I can see that the field of my ideal job is not as high in demand as others but I am still passionate about it. I will keep this data in mind but I will still follow my roadmap into ICT Infrastructure Support Analyst.</p>
				<p><b>Campbell:</b> Being a game developer had been on my mind for a while now. The data from Burning Glass Technologies show that there are high demands for developers, so my ideal job hasn't changed. I will take the general skills data into consideration and will continue to work on communication skills and other highly desired general skills.</p>
				<p><b>Tom:</b> Given that I am seeking a job in the broader Systems Engineer area, it is reassuring that there should be at least as many, if not more opportunities to attain my ideal job (or something similar to it), given the projected industry growth and demand.
				<br><br>The IT specific skills required appear daunting now, especially given my relative inexperience and newcomer status in terms of IT. However these are things I will be incrementally working towards over a period of years. Setting short-, medium- and long-terms goals will allow for steady progression towards building my ideal career.</p>
				<p><b>Tung:</b> As a Computer and System Engineer, I think that I am happy where I am. Although my future is not certain and I could possibly branch out to different areas, my career path is definitely looking good as it is. There is good demand for my area and I don’t think that there is a big issue in this industry. Like the others, I will consider the general skills but ultimately do not intend for any big changes.</p>
