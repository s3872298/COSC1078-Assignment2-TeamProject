							disc-based games in her childhood. 

							Belle also has minor experience in HTML/CSS from previous studies and volunteer work, where she worked alongside programmers and coders on an online game. The main reason to study this course is to enhance her knowledge and learn more
							about her interests.</p>

				<h2>Group processes</h2>
				<p> As a group, we all felt that we worked very well together and we all had a very positive experience, which in itself was what every single member of the group found to be the most surprising thing!
					It was a learning experience for all of us to work with a team where everyone was pulling their weight and committed to getting the work done and done well.
					Most importantly, we learnt how crucial communication, organisation and presence are in ensuring that group work gets completed to the highest standard it can be,
					which were - fortunately - areas where we believe we excelled in:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Communication:</b> As a group we made very effective use of Microsoft Teams as our communication platform. Everyone had a voice in our group meetings and we made sure to get everyone’s input when making decisions.</li>
					<li><b>Organisation:</b> Using Microsoft Teams to remind each other of anything that needs to be done and updating each other our progress has been integral to keeping each other accountable for our own individual work. Having a Google
						Drive folder and a group repository to collect all our work together really helps when we need to cross-reference different parts of the assignment and also works as an effective way to visually see our progress.</li>
					<li><b>Presence:</b> Every meeting so far has had full attendance, where everyone comes with a positive attitude and willingness to work together and collaborate.</li>
				</ul>
				Where the group believed we could improve on was how assessment tasks could be better divided in the future. While it was great that our group got itself organised early on, on reflection we probably should have split the assignment tasks up
				in a less compartmentalised way. Our initial method of division reflected the way in which the assignment marks were split up, and we therefore each 'specialised' in one particular area of the assignment. While we all kept each other updated
				about our respective parts, we didn't really get a feel for the assignment until it was completed, and we could read it as an entire document. After discussions with Anthony, we have decided to rectify this by using the Kanban app on teams to
				allocate tasks, and divide assignment 3 in a way that we each contribute to every section. Doing so will allow us to create a more cohesive assignment with better flow, and at the same time allow us the opportunity to work more closely
				together and share ideas.
