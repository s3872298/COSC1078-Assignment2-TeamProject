				<h1 class="major">Ideal Jobs</h1>
				<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
				<p>Although the group of six are all interested in the IT industry, there is not a common career path we share. Elements that are common within each ideal job is that we are expecting to use technology in the day-to-day operations of our
					jobs. The IT knowledge we obtain from this course will be used to increase our work experience in the future. Several of our current jobs have been impacted by the global pandemic which has given us the opportunity to study once again to
					enhance their current skill sets.</p>
				<p>The job requirements in our ideal jobs revolve around the compulsory requirement of a completed IT course or other degrees with the voluntary completion of an IT course. Given current circumstances, we all expect it will be difficult to
					find a suitable role and look for a low tier job or internship to start our journey.</p>
				<p>We all have significant differences in each role. We have ideal jobs in accounting, IT and even law, however we all have a good understanding of the roadmap to our final career path. There are also common aspirations to work in a large
					firm, although all different, we appreciate the status that comes with these companies. Larger companies also allow for greater opportunities, such as for Campbell’s desire to develop a game. This differentiates from Andrew’s goal as he
					aims to start his own firm one day.</p>
				<p>Across the group, we are quite diverse and are unlikely to work in the same field, however we could still work together and keep in contact with each other and use our expertise in our respective fields to collaborate on a project in the
					future.</p>
				</br>

				<h1 class="major">Career Plans</h1>
				<p>The ideal jobs vary among the whole group. Since assignments 1 and 2, none of the group's career plans or ideal jobs have changed. However,
					we all collectively agree that this course has contributed in guiding us to the correct direction. Our plans remain the same, but we have
					developed skills and experiences that will benefit our careers. No two jobs are exactly the same and therefore the group have outlined
					points regarding their career plan and ideal job. Our ideal jobs vary quite differently but some have similar career plans such as to
					complete a bachelor’s degree.</p>
				</br>
				<p>
					<b>Belle’s career plans:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Since assignment 1 and 2, her career plan has not changed too much in the sense that she’d like to pursue a career that combines two
						fields of interest for her, with the primary one being of a legal nature.</li>
					<li>Her ideal job, which was already a hybrid of the legal sector and IT, has not changed much as a result, as her interest in IT was greatly renewed thanks to taking this short course.</li>
				</ul>

				<b>Tom’s career plans:</b>
				<ul><br>
					<li>Tom’s career plan is very much a work in progress and he is not sure if he will pursue a geospatial science degree after the COVID
						short course (or anything IT related for that matter). </li>
					<li>He is glad he took the course, but more in terms of it demonstrated that IT is something he does not want to pursue. </li>
				</ul>

				<b>Ben’s career plan:</b>
				<ul><br>
					<li>Ben’s career plans will still be achieved in a similar way as what was outlined in assignment 1 and 2 by completing his Bachelor of
						Information and Technology at RMIT university hopefully majoring in networking. </li>
					<li>Ben’s career plan is still similar to what was presented in assignment 1 and assignment 2 with his ideal job still being in network Infrastructure. If that’s not possible for some reason,
						anything in networking would be an exciting endeavor. </li>
				</ul>

				<b>Tung’s career plan:</b>
				<ul><br>
					<li>Tung’s career plan presented in A1 and A2 is still only one of many possibilities. He is considering many options and for now studying
						IT is the direction he wishes to head in. Upon completion of his COVID19 short-course in IT, he hopes to move into and start a Bachelor
						degree of IT in 2021.</li>
					<li>Tung’s ideal job is to apply his customer-service and small business experience into the IT field, and as a result,
						working as an IT professional for a business company is still his ideal job. </li>
				</ul>

				<b>Campbell’s career plan:</b>
				<ul><br>
					<li>Campbell’s career plan is mostly the same as it was in assignment 1 and 2. He is exploring various options sticking to the area of
						IT as that is what he is most passionate about. </li>
					<li>Campbell’s ideal job is to utilise his experience in the gaming industry to help generate a better and more enjoyable product in the role of a game developer.</li>
					<li>Alternatively, he would also love to work in a role which combines sports and IT.</li>
				</ul>

				<b>Andrew’s career plan: </b>
				<ul><br>
					<li>Andrew’s plan has remained the same from assignment 1 and 2. He intends to stay in the accounting profession and is currently on the
						correct path by completing his university degree.</li>
					<li>Andrew’s ideal job is quite different from the rest of the group but will continue
						his IT interests as a hobby rather than a career path. </li>
				</ul>
