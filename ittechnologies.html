							<div>
								<p>Cybersecurity is at the frontlines of protecting personal and professional assets in a modern and dynamic world of cloud storage, online banking and network solutions. There are many different applications for cybersecurity and it is an ever changing and highly sought after position by businesses in the information technology industry.</p>
								<p><a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-malware-what-is-cybersecurity-what-you-need-to-know.html">Norton states the applications of cybersecurity at the moment are</a>:
									<ul>
										<li>Critical infrastructure security</li>
										<li>Network security</li>
										<li>Application security</li>
										<li>Information security</li>
										<li>Cloud security</li>
										<li>Data loss prevention</li>
										<li>End-user education</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p><a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-malware-what-is-cybersecurity-what-you-need-to-know.html">Norton also provides a list of different types of cyber threats that can occur</a>:
									<ul>
										<li>Preventing social engineering, APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats)</li>
										<li>Preventing malware</li>
										<li>Preventing ransomware</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>The different types of attacks that can occur are attacks on confidentiality, attacks on integrity and attacks on availability. Attacks on confidentiality are designed to take personal information about a customer or client in order to sell the information elsewhere. Attacks on integrity are when information is stolen about a business and leaked online. Finally, attacks on availability are normally when an unauthorized user accesses a network and uses ransomware to lock out parts of a business and demands a payment from a business for the hacker to unlock those areas of the network that the business requires to operate <a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-malware-what-is-cybersecurity-what-you-need-to-know.html">normally.</a></p>
								<p>Cybersecurity is a pretty exciting industry in terms of what are the possibilities of this technology. With the breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and machine learning this leads to exciting new possibilities with cybersecurity, like including an adaptive AI into the protection of your network and assets is a good way of staying on top of network threats. This artificial intelligence would have to be able to effectively predict where network threats are likely to occur, as well as comb through business data to look for infectious and nefarious programs and remove them like a white blood cell would remove a virus from your body.</p>
								<p>Implementing this technology into cybersecurity can certainly help, and to some extent has already been implemented in the defence of networks. According to an article <i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-019-0109-1">Trusting artificial intelligence in cybersecurity is a double-edged sword 2019</a></i> artificial intelligence and machine learning are already being used to defeat attacks autonomously, generate strategies for the attack in the future and even generate decoys and create honeypots for attackers to steal instead of actual any business IP that would be detrimental to a business’s unique assets. However, from the same article, it’s also shown that an AI that is used to protect a business from cyber attacks can actually be repurposed to steal information and poison data streams. If done correctly by an attacker, this can be very difficult to discover due to artificial intelligence programs sometimes lacking transparency.</p>
								<p>Like most aspects of information technology and engineering, automation of cybersecurity is a very likely possibility for the future of this technology. A key aspect of this will be the ever evolving abilities of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The main issue that employees tasked with protecting a network face is the volume of attacks that a business might face daily, and this can become overwhelming for one or even many people trying to constantly defend against these automated attacks. The detection of threats before they happen will be the future of cybersecurity especially threats that haven’t actually happened yet.</p>
								<p>The impacts of implementing AI and machine learning into cybersecurity to automate some aspects are pretty substantial in terms of minimising human effort. The amount of effort required for a network security department to manually skim through network logs and alerts could be manageable if they didn’t have very much in the way of network infrastructure, but when you get to huge companies like Google, Amazon or even military grade networks it would almost be impossible to stop all the cyber attacks that occur manually. In addition to this, the tolerance for discovering a possible threat and then trying to stop the attack before it was complete would be very small. Most of the time, if a new kind of cyber attack was discovered it might be after the attack has already successfully occurred, leading to the business having to invest their time into damage control to try and discover what data was stolen or what the ramifications of this breach could mean for their company.</p>
								<p>The market for cybersecurity is growing rapidly, a post by Forbes estimates that the current cybersecurity market is worth “173B in 2020” and suggests that it might grow <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2020/04/05/2020-roundup-of-cybersecurity-forecasts-and-market-estimates/#b176906381d7">“to 270B by 2026”</a>. In addition to this, the U.S bureau of statistics estimates that the job market for positions such as information security analysts will increase by 31% between 2019 to 2029 while SEEK estimates job growth of 18% for the same position over the next five years. From these statistics, it’s clear to see that the cybersecurity industry is growing rapidly and will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, an information security analyst is only one kind job in the cybersecurity industry; other types of jobs in cybersecurity can be  programming, infrastructure, security engineers and much more.</p>
								<p>The effects that cybersecurity will have on an everyday user’s life are huge and are felt almost every day and it’s becoming easier for an everyday user to implement cybersecurity into their lives. The ramifications of cyber attacks for an end user could be devastating to their lives, whether that is a personal information leaked for public viewing or their personal data is stolen and used by someone else.This is also true if a user were to access a network that doesn’t have adequate network security or entrust their personal details to a business that doesn’t protect their assets well enough, or are ethically compromised and sell customer data to ad companies for profit could lead to some serious consequences for a user in the future.</p>
								<p>The reason why we're so focused on the end-user in this context is because they are everyday people like us who are trying to make it in this ever changing world of the internet and being constantly connected to some sort of network. Luckily for the end-users, there are always ways that you can protect yourself and your privacy while browsing the internet and connecting to networks. Simple methods such as: not clicking on strange links or opening foregin emails, using strong passwords that include a mixture of numbers, lower and upper case letters and symbols, using two-factor authentication, avoiding using unsecure wifis and using virtual private networks can all be ways an end-user like RMIT students can employ simple network security methods to keep online browsing safe.</p>
								<p>With services and businesses quickly going online, it is so important for an end-user like myself and my family to protect themselves online from malicious and nefarious cyber attacks that prey on the naivety of users. In addition to this, it is crucially important that when an end-user can’t control the level of cybersecurity used, like when they access everyday services such as online banking, the security of the end-users that use the product or service is held to high regard by the company, because many people put their trust in a service to deliver a safe and stress free experience for their customers.</p>

							<h2 id="cloudserviceserver">Clouds, Services and Servers</h2>
							<div>
								<p>In the modern age of technology, some computer users struggle to find enough space to store all of their data on hard drives or other external storage devices. This is where cloud storage and servers can play an influential part in retaining this information. Cloud storage is a service where data and information is stored on remote storage systems accessible through a network, commonly the internet.</p>
								<p>The two main types of cloud storages are public and private cloud. Public cloud offers almost unlimited scalability, both up and down, and reliable services at a lower price, however have less control over the security of the data. Meanwhile a private cloud offers higher security and greater control and customisation to align with the businesses intentions, although has a higher initial cost and less scalability in terms of storage space.</p>
								<p>Dedicated servers also store data via the internet; however, they utilise physical servers exclusive to the client. Primarily, large organisations utilise dedicated servers while individuals use cloud storage. Companies choose dedicated servers due to the faster processing and information retrieval since the data is locally processed. Meanwhile cloud storage is a cheaper alternative along with the practicality of not requiring a server room in the individuals’ home.</p>
								<p>With the ever-increasing processing times within cloud storage services, many choose to ditch hard drives as their primary storage location. Steve Jobs, Co-founder, CEO and Chairman of Apple Inc., states that he “[doesn’t] need a hard disk in [his] computer if [he] can access the server faster”. However, in saying this it is smart to have at least one completely separate storage location to back everything up just in case something does happen.</p>
								<p>Currently, the top companies offering cloud storage offer the best security, to match their ease of use and processing speed. Features such as two-factor authentication, where the user must have access to two devices in order to log in, provide an extra barrier to help keep the users’ data safe and secure. Other state of the art features include the ability to edit files without requiring downloading the file first or file versioning, where the cloud service automatically creates a backup of the edited file so the user can revert to a previous version in case of in irreversible mistake.</p>
								<p>Many suggest that the future of cloud storage is advancements in hybrid storage. IT professionals were asked ‘what’s the future of cloud computing?’ Michael Corrado, World Wide Marketing Manager for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, suggested “a hybrid IT solution”. Tom Gillis, Founder and CEO of Bracket Computing, answered “a radically different hybrid cloud computing model”. In addition, Jeff Fisher, VP, Strategic Alliance & Category Creating Enterprise Technology Executive at Kemptechnologies, responded that “the future of cloud computing is undeniably hybrid”.</p>
								<p>Hybrid cloud computing is the combination of and communication between a private cloud and one or more public clouds to achieve a more efficient outcome. Ideally, the user can use both cloud environments together through their usual workflow with a seamless flow of information. This allows businesses to store their confidential information on the more secure private cloud or local server, while concurrently storing the rest of their data on the cheaper and scalable public cloud.</p>
								<p>Developments in technology such as machine learning, automation and artificial intelligence is critical in the improvements and evolution in hybrid cloud storage. This would allow it to run faster and smoother, while allowing the user to store more information within the high performance hybrid cloud.</p>
								<p>As hybrid storage improves and grows in popularity, businesses across the world would slowly transfer across from the dedicated servers they currently use. In addition, with the amount of organisations going out of business due to the coronavirus lockdown, it is very plausible that those who take their place after the lockdown elect to go with hybrid storage as they first start.</p>
								<p>For the average consumer, transferring from hard drives and external storage devices to cloud storage is suggested due to the increased storage capacity, ease of use and organisation capabilities of it. However, while it can vary from person to person, it is unlikely there is enough reason to switch from cloud storage to hybrid storage as the added security does not outweigh the cost.</p>
								<p>Business areas such as hospitals and medical clinics rely on their dedicated servers in order to keep all of the patients’ private and important information secure and confidential. As these companies have so many patients, they are unlikely to switch to hybrid storage as the security is significantly stronger while storage capacity remains high. On the other hand, business without confidential about their customers would be inclined to convert to hybrid storage as it has a far lower upfront cost to set up instead of inbuilt physical servers. With the improvements made in cloud storage in terms of usability, smaller companies would find it extremely easy to start up and organise all of their files and documents.</p>
								<p>The increase in businesses transferring from dedicated servers to hybrid cloud storage would not make them redundant as they still have an important place in some areas, but their use would drastically drop off over time. Additionally, as hybrid cloud improves at the same time, the security levels will increase to match dedicated servers, eventually replacing them entirely down the line.</p>
								<p>With the increasing use of cloud storage for the average consumer, the connection it has between devices can prove to be incredibly helpful and time saving. The days of running out of storage on your phone and not even being able to take a photo are over. All photos will be save directly to the cloud storage. In addition, the time taken connecting the phone to a computer with a hard drive connected is cut down as you can easily connect both devices to a cloud storage service.</p>
								<p>While it may not be very noticeable for the user on a day-to-day basis, a cloud service is an organised way to store pictures, videos, files and documents. It also provides an easy connection between all of the users’ devices. However, it is still important to have a hard drive or some other form of storage as a back-up location. Cloud makes backing up data even easier as it is all in one place ready to copy across to a separate storage location.</p>
								<p>Cloud storage provides a low cost, reliable and scalable service, which is a great option for anyone in any situation. It is especially helpful for those struggling to organise all of their data across the multiple hard drives strewn around their house. With how quick and easy it is to set up, it can instantly improve someone’s data storage arrangement.</p>

							<h2 id="machinelearning">Machine Learning</h2>
							<div>
								<p>Machine learning is the ability for computer systems to extrapolate unordered or labelled data on its own to develop algorithms and processes to complete tasks more efficiently and effectively. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-machine-learning-everything-you-need-to-know">In a ZDNet post about machine learning, Nick Heath</a> describes the difference between “traditional computer software is that a human developer hasn’t written code that instructs the system how to tell the difference between the banana and the apple. Instead a machine-learning model has been taught how to reliably discriminate between the fruits by being trained on a large amount of data." The main takeaway from the statement is that machine learning is like trying to teach someone something new: it just requires a lot of information and repetition but eventually it will become ingrained within the person’s brain.</p>
								<p>Big data companies such as Google and Facebook are really demonstrating what state-of-the-art for machine learning is. The scope of Google's implementation of machine learning into all of their products is pretty astounding. Machine learning is in Google products such as Gmail, Google Maps, Google's search engine, the Google Assistant, Google Translate and many more of their products.</p>
								<p>There are many applications of machine learning that are in use today. Some of them include:
									<ul>
										<li>Online shopping websites like Amazon recommending products</li>
										<li>Streaming services recommending what to watch based on previous items streamed</li>
										<li>Google and Facebook recommending ads based on search history</li>
										<li>Outlook recognizing and removing suspicious emails from your inbox</li>
										<li>Predictive text trying to predict what word you are going to need next or what phrase you are about to type out</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>The main technology that will be focused on in this report is autonomous vehicles. <a href="https://iiot-world.com/artificial-intelligence-ml/machine-learning/machine-learning-algorithms-in-autonomous-driving/">A post from the IIoT World</a> explains “one of the main tasks of any machine learning algorithm in the self-driving car is a continuous rendering of the surrounding environment and the prediction of the possible changes to those surroundings”. The challenge of this is developing a computer system that will be able to compute all the data coming in from all of the sensors, cameras and radars needed to visualise the surroundings into a logical and accurate prediction of what could happen.</p>
								<p>The use of deep learning to improve on machine learning will be a vital component to make autonomous vehicles. Deep learning is a subclass of machine learning and it’s when a deep neural network is developed for a computer system so that it can improve on its own accord without the need of human intervention. The more data and scenarios that a network of autonomous vehicles can be introduced to, the more likely it will be that the autonomous vehicle will be able to act in a way that will simulate a real driver.</p>
								<p><a href="https://au.mathworks.com/discovery/deep-learning.html">Some of the other applications of deep learning are:</a>
									<ul>
										<li>Virtual assistants</li>
										<li>Medical research</li>
										<li>Hearing and speech recognition</li>
										<li>WorkSafe to ensure the safety of workers around automated machinery</li>
										<li>Aerospace and Defence</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>The impact of this development is limitless and incredibly exciting in terms of the technology advancements that are possible by utilizing a deep neural network (DNN) for new technologies like autonomous vehicles, medical imaging and virtual assistants. Although, these new technological advancements don’t come without its own issues.</p>
								<p>Some likely changes that will be seen with DNNs are that they are built with many different layers of algorithms which result in complex software architecture. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07517.pdf">“An explanation for a certain decision made by a DNN cannot be retrieved by simply scrutinizing the inference process”</a>, which demonstrates that as a DNN are created with more and more layers and have a more complex architecture, this will mean that the source of the decisions made by the DNN will become more and more ambiguous. This change to independent learning for machine learning will lead to some difficulty in debugging decisions if the network picks up on trends that are socially or ethically inappropriate.</p>
								<p>While there are some setbacks to DNNs there are still positives to them also. If self driving cars become commonplace on the roads in the near future, the ability for people who weren’t able to drive in cars previously might be able to live a more independent life using this new technology. In addition to this, other deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) which is a type of network that is designed to analyze images will be implemented into the medical industry to process MRI results or x-rays. Studies are also starting to show that <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/features/what-is-deep-learning-and-how-will-it-change-healthcare">“some CNNs are approaching - or even surpassing - the accuracy of human diagnosticians when identifying important features in diagnostic imaging studies”</a>. This demonstrates that the potential for the uses of neural networks are not just limited to one industry and has the potential to help people across most industries that require the extrapolation of data.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately machine learning is key in the production of artificial intelligence and automation, which is certainly the way the world is going and that means that there will definitely be jobs that may no longer exist in the future. There is a high possibility that all data input and analysis jobs will all become more efficient and effective with machine learning instead of humans, so there is the possibility that whole industries will no longer support human jobs for those roles.</p>
								<p>Machine learning is already prevalent in today’s society so it is already affecting everyone in their daily lives. We all have access to Google services and Facebook which in many aspects is run by machine learning. All of your search history and cookies are being collected by these companies and made into context for their advertisements that will be constantly viewed and clicked on by their users. These advertisements are crucially important for companies to get revenue so they will try to put them in view for their users.</p>
								<p>This is important because it changes your ability to manage your privacy if you decide to use these services. If all of your data is constantly being collected by these companies it can leave your personal information in a position that you wouldn’t be able to control the distribution of this information. This can lead to your data being vulnerable to hackers and company data breaches. Of course, it’s not all bad outcomes from machine learning and it can be used to improve a user’s experience through providing sophisticated image and data processing neural networks to allow real-time updates about a planned journey in Google maps. Finally, machine learning and deep learning is an interesting topic and is still a new technology with huge potential. These technologies have the potential to improve the predictive capabilities of many businesses and services. It’s crucial that the users like myself, my friends and family aren’t left behind in terms of the transparency of these technologies. It’s a slippery slope if the user's privacy is neglected so that the services that we use can exploit our personal data so they can get more revenue through ads or analytics.</p>

							<h2 id="naturallanguage">Natural Language Processing and Chatter Bots</h2>
							<div>
								<p>Everything we say or write carries an incredible amount of information along with it, outside of just the content. It also includes things like tone and selection of words that can drastically change what we mean. This is easy for humans to notice and understand due to the constant exposure to language every day. The fact that we are speaking it every day allows us to predict the behaviour of other based off this additional information outside of just the topic. Natural language processing is the connection between computers and the human language. It is a type of artificial intelligence, which helps computers to read and interpret human language.</p>
								<p>The improvements in this technology has allowed for the introduction of chatterbots. Chatterbots are computer programs designed to simulate a human conversation, spoken or written. This allows a human to interact with a computer seamlessly. This interaction may vary from a simple single-line answer to the users question to a digital assistant that has learnt to give increasing levels of personalisation. There are three main types of chatterbots, rule-based or algorithmic chatterbots, intelligent chatterbots using machine learning, and AI-powered chatterbots.</p>
								<p>Machine learning allows the device learn language as it is exposed to more and more of it. This means that it starts at a lower level but has an incredibly high ceiling as it improves with time. This allows the computer to pick up on the minor details presented through tone, volume and tempo, which would not have been possible. Meanwhile, an algorithmic approach teaches the chatterbot to recognise patterns, key words, or phrases. This gives the computer a strong starting point straight away, however it will not develop any further knowledge of its own, meaning the language rules provided by the programmer is the limit.</p>
								<p>AI-powered chatterbots combine the use of algorithms with machine learning in order to create the most realistic simulation of a human interaction. These chatterbots have the ability to remember past conversations as well as adapt to the user and understand user preferences. This makes the interaction between humans and the computer feel more natural.</p>
								<p>Rule-based chatterbots are common on websites with an expandable text chat option usually in the bottom right corner. These chatterbots answer any questions or queries the customer may have by comparing the input to the algorithm and patterns and providing the user with a pre-determined answer.</p>
								<p>AI-powered chatterbots are present in many household products such as the Google Assistant, Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. These use voice driven chatterbots where the device interprets the voice command and completes the desired action. They search for key words or phrases such as “find a recipe for…”, “what is…” or “play…” to determine the action, before accurately identifying the topic within the content provided by the user. The device uses this information to search for a recipe, definition, song or any other request. Meanwhile they also have the ability to remember past conversations, and adapt to the users way of speaking and common choice of words.</p>
								<p><a href="https://neurohive.io/en/news/meena-Google-s-new-state-of-the-art-chatbot/">In January 2020, Google announced the newest, state of the art, chatterbot named Meena.</a> The company believed that everyday chatterbots tended to be highly specialised and did not perform well when the user strayed too far from its intended use. <a href="https://ai.Googleblog.com/2020/01/towards-conversational-agent-that-can.html">This was the idea behind creating Meena, to make a chatterbot that can communicate about almost any topic.</a> Meena has a network model with 2.6 billion parameters and was trained using 341 GB’s of text.</p>
								<p>As chatterbot technology improves in the near future, programs with the capabilities of Meena can become more mainstream and be included in devices such as the Google Assistant, while also being introduced in a live chat option on website.</p>
								<p>The developments of this technology could mean that it acts as the customer support section of a website as it is more personalised and can retrieve information shortly after the customer asks a question. It can also help the user resolve problems they may have been having. As the company does not need to pay for wages when utilising a chatterbot over a customer service employee, it is a far cheaper alternative with a high success rate. This lower cost incentivises businesses to introduce customer service chatterbots across all fields, forcing those employees into redundancy and out of a job.</p>
								<p>According to a survey conducted on Facebook in the United States, over 50% of customers say they are more likely to shop with a business if they can connect through a live chat. Dominos have introduced a chatterbot named Dom, with whom you can ask questions and place orders through the Facebook Messenger app.</p>
								<p>A survey conducted by Drift, Audience, Salesforce and Myclever, asked participants what frustrations they had experienced within the past month. The results show that 34% had found sites hard to navigate, 31% could not find answers to simple questions, and 27% found that it took too long to find their desired service. The addition of a chatterbot on these websites could be influential in assisting the customer in finding what they want. A simple chat box gives the customer the option to ask questions and find what they want.</p>
								<p>The results to these two surveys demonstrate a great incentive either for businesses to include a chatterbot feature on their own website, or in a messaging app. It could increase profits through both not requiring an employee, as well as helping customers who may have otherwise struggled and given up.</p>
								<p>For the average consumer, improvements in the technology behind chatterbots and natural language processing could provide a far better customer service system. This will vastly decrease the time spent on websites, struggling to find what the customer wants.  Along with customer service chatterbots, businesses will start to introduce and improve chatterbots on messaging apps. These are used to help the customer place orders quicker and easier than ordering online.</p>
								<p>Christi Olson, head of evangelism for search at Bing, stated, “Gartner predicts that by 2020 people will have more conversations with chatbots than their spouse”. While this may not be entirely true, people are heading down that path. As the technology evolves and becomes more prevalent in peoples everyday actions, it is definitely still possible in the near future.</p>
								<p>These days, majority of homes have a chatterbot device in the form of a mobile phone or a Google Home or Amazon Echo, which include Google Assistant, Alexa or Siri. As the AI-powered chatterbots improve and edge closer to simulating a high quality human conversation, users will have more and more interaction with these devices. Everyday tasks will include more uses for chatterbot assistants, slowly transitioning towards conversations with these devices without any service required.</p>
