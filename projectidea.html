				<p>
					For this project, we aim to create a mobile application for iOS devices that, upon completion, will serve to help Victorians better navigate their way around the law and justice system. This application will thus have a twofold purpose:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>To aggregate different legal services available within Victoria -</b> Given the wide range of avenues through which Victorians can ask for legal assistance, it may be intimidating to know where to start. Additionally, people may not
						know that other such alternatives exist, and believe that the most expensive option is the only one available. To combat both of these scenarios, the app will primarily focus on centralising the main sources of legal assistance: community
						legal centres, Victoria Legal Aid, Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, and lawyers/law firms.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						<b>To provide general resources for Victorians to learn about and understand the law, regardless of what language they speak -</b> The law is complex and comprehensive, often written in ways that make it difficult for people to understand
						without the legal know-how to parse the jargon. Those who can’t speak the language are even more so at a disadvantage. As such, the app’s secondary focus will be providing resources in plain English that can be understood by all
						Victorians, as well as having those same resources (where possible) be translated in a multitude of different languages. A feature where users can ask questions about the law, which will be answered by qualified lawyers/legal
						professionals, will also be added to enhance the informative aspect of the app. Additionally, interpreters and interpreting services are essential when it comes to helping those unable to speak English effectively navigate the law, and
						this app will provide space for those services to be accessed.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<hr>

				<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

				<p>
					The law and justice system should be impartial. To achieve this, everyone should have access to it and be judged fairly in the court of law. The legal system only works when everyone is informed of the law and their rights, and understands
					how the law is implemented and upheld. Given that we live in a capitalist society with no limit to monetary gain, obtaining legal representation has become very costly, and high quality representation is very much available only to those
					who can afford it.</p>

				<p>
					Considering the state of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52951093" target="_blank">America and the protests</a> happening across the country, as well as the persisting divisions that are reinforced by the <a
						href="https://www.alrc.gov.au/publication/pathways-to-justice-inquiry-into-the-incarceration-rate-of-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples-alrc-report-133/3-incidence/over-representation/" target="_blank">over-representation of
						Indigenous peoples in Australia</a>, there is a clear divide between law enforcers and the people they should be protecting. A problem lies with law enforcers who are exploiting the law for their own gain and individuals who aren’t fully
					informed of the law to properly protect themselves from such exploitations.</p>

				<p>
					Humanity as a whole is becoming a much more technologically advanced society, where information about these topics should be easily accessible to the masses, using technology will be instrumental in removing the factors that hinder people
					from accessing the justice system, particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged Victorians.</p>

				<p>
					Having a free mobile application that anyone can install onto their phones means that legal services can be easily delivered to those who would best benefit from it, but perhaps may not be able to access them due to factors such as:
				<ul>
					<li>being unable to afford private legal representation</li>
					<li>living in rural areas where legal resources are limited</li>
					<li>not knowing where to look for legal advice, not being able to consult someone for legal advice, or not being able to understand legal advice given</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
					As such, we hope this mobile application proves particularly beneficial to Victorians affected by these factors.</p>

				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					We aim to create a mobile application for iOS devices that aggregates legal services throughout Victoria and improves their accessibility. This application will primarily aim to both connect users, particularly disadvantaged demographic, to
					legal services that can provide them with the assistance they require, while having a secondary aim of educating a wider audience of the law and the rights afforded to them.</p>

				<p>
					<b>GOAL ONE: <i>Determine the final pool of potential features to be included in the application.</i></b></p>

				<p>
					Given that this project could include a plurality of features to cover all the legal assistance that could be provided in Victoria, we had to limit the scope of this project in terms of practicality and plausibility. When we discussed what
					features we could add or remove from the application based on what Belle wrote in A1 and what we expanded upon in A2, we decided that on our pool of potential features (CLC finder, lawyer/law firm finder, VLA, legal repository, ask a
					lawyer) that we could further remove and adjust as necessary.</p>

				<p>
					<b>GOAL TWO: <i>Aggregating all the legal information necessary to influence how extensive the future design needs to be / what needs to be accommodated.</i></B></p>

				<p>
					As we work to determine what features will eventually make it to the final prototype, it was important to see whether the information we want to share with the public is available and, if so, how extensive it is. This is so that we can
					better anticipate how the UI design will best be presented to cater for readability as well as determining what database will be needed to host all of this information in the future.</p>

				<p>
					<b>GOAL THREE: <i>Have a working prototype of the UI of the mobile application (building upon goal two).</i></B></p>

				<p>
					Producing a prototype is essential to the developmental process of this project. Using Figma to create a working UI that demonstrates how the features are used and interacted with allows us to practically work out the kinks and presentation
					of our project. It also opens up the possibilities for user testing and improvements. Producing this early enough in our developmental process means we can properly identify and flush out features and design elements that don’t work or need
					to be reiterated through testing. It should also be stated that testing is a constant process that we would continue throughout development all the way through the final product.</p>

				<p>
					<b>GOAL FOUR: <i>Establish a database where all of the important legal information can be held.</i></b></p>

				<p>
					In order to design an application that aggregates and provides resources to legal information, it is expected that it will contain a database to house it all. Instead of providing external resources to our users, we want to collect that
					information and let them access it directly. Using SQLite for the database allows us to store all the information locally on the users phone, when they download the app, which means users can access quickly and also offline. Doing so will
					make our application feel meaningful and useful, and set it apart from users having to look up the resources online.</p>

				<p>
					<b>GOAL FIVE: <i>The viability of working with Xamarin to create our legal application.</i></b></p>

				<p>
					Doing more research and looking into other mobile-app development software that we can use in-case there are better alternatives. Although Xamarin looks promising with cross-platform development between iOS and Android, and beginner
					tutorials there may be other programs that can do the same thing that are easier to use. We should explore and research our options and find what is ideal for the development of our application in-order to move forward with our project.</p>

				<p>
					<b>GOAL SIX: <i>Figuring out how to fuse the database with the functionality of the application.</i></b></p>

				<p>
					Once we have the ui / application complete and the database established, the final step in development of the app is to connect the two together. Making sure users are able to access all the information provided in the database while using
					the application. This is to make sure that our application is fully functional and fulfills its primary objective before we can move forward with the project.</p>

				<p>
					<b>GOAL SEVEN: <i>Considerations of how to host the mobile app and distribute it.</i></b></p>

				<p>
					How do we host our application? Are there any costs to hosting our application? If so, how do we generate the resources? Do we have an effective marketing plan? - Once production of the application is finished, we need to come up with a
					plan on how to move forward in regards to costs of hosting and further maintenance of the app once it launches. Not too mention advertising and raising awareness for the application. If we underestimate this process and fail to market our
					application properly there are big risks that users don’t even know the application exists (this was a key problem identified in a previous Victorian Legal Aid report relating to a sexual consent app).</p>

				<hr>

				<h2 id="plansandprogress">Plans and Progress</h2>
				<p>
				<h3>How did the project begin?</h3>

				The project was initially Belle’s personal project idea, which was something that was inspired by Belle’s recent completion of a Criminology/Law & Justice focused degree, and was furthered by Belle’s current career as a transcriptionist for
				Victoria Police. Accessibility (and lack thereof) of the law and justice system, specifically the courts, was something she studied extensively, and how the paradigms of injustice are reinforced because people:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>could not physically access justice</li>
					<li>could not monetarily afford justice</li>
					<li>could not understand the law because it was written in a way that not everyone can understand</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Belle spent most of Assignment 1 brainstorming ways through which technology could address these above barriers, and settled on a mobile application because it was something that could easily slide legal knowledge into the pockets of many.
					In Assignment 2, the group selected to build upon this project idea given how plausible it was to accomplish compared to the other group members’ idea. The group furthered upon the work completed by Belle in Assignment 1, expanding upon the
					motivations of the project to define the tenet of the application: empowering disadvantaged Victorians. Assignment 2 was also when new features were added in light of this, as well as a deeper exploration of the team’s IT skill set to
					execute and complete this project.</p>

				<h3>How has the project progressed?</h3>

				<p>
					The development of Goony’s legal aid application has followed the intended aim and scope of the project that was discussed at the planning stage of this project. The scope of our project has limited us to creating a working user interface
					that will base the continuation of the project for the next 10 weeks of development.</p>

				<p>
					We started by breaking down the project into a series of functional requirements that would assist Goony in delivering their intended aim of providing a legal aid service to people who may not have knowledge in or don't have resources to
					access legal services elsewhere.

					The features that Goony settled on were:

				<ol>
					<li>Map screen with community legal centre locations (including a search function)</li>
					<li>Victoria Legal Aid (VLA) information</li>
					<li>Staff login (for VLA staff, law firm staff/lawyers etc.)</li>
					<li>Law firm directory/search (by area of specialisation, location, pro bono, etc)</li>
					<li>Law firm directory posting for each firm (contact details, status, website etc.). This will include back end functionalities (thanks to a database) which will allow this posting to be edited/updated by their respective law firm/lawyer
					</li>
					<li>A “library” of other law resources, including: A Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service section; Plain English Legal information (articles/informative videos, etc); Resources translated into languages other than English, as well as links to
						various interpreter services; An “Ask a Lawyer” function</li>
				</ol>
				</p>

				<h3>Production</h3>

				<p>
					Once we settled on a series of functional requirements for the application, Goony then moved on to creating mock-ups of the user interface. Creating a user interface for an application requires the integration of the intended functional
					requirements in a way that promotes usability of the application. Using a series of standardised design principles in tandem with Nielson’s heuristics we started to mock-up some ideas for the user interface.</p>

				<span class='image right'><img src="images/consistencyandstandards.png" alt="Consistency and Standards">
				</span>

				<h4>Consistency and Standards</h4>
				<p>
					It’s important for an interface to have consistency in its functionality. The Find a Lawyer/Law Firm features and the Find a Community Center were thus designed to have similar functions.
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>

				<span class='image left'><img src="images/prominence.png" alt="Prominence">
				</span>

				<h4>Prominence</h4>
				<p>
					It’s important for users to have their eyes drawn to what we deem as important features of the application. Our Victorian Aboriginal Legal service section demonstrates this principle by having the users eyes drawn to the VALS hotline.
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<span class='image right'><img src="images/aesthetics andminimalistdesign.png" alt="Aesthetics and Minimalist Design"></span>

				<h4>Aesthetics and Minimalist Design</h4>
				<p>
					The below wireframe drafts shows initial versions of our homepage and Victorian Legal Aid section, which reflects the heuristic of minimalist design by only having the important features of our application on the homepage.
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<span class='image left'><img src="images/systemrealworld.png" alt="Match Between System and the Real World"></span>

				<h4>Match Between System and the Real World</h4>

				<p>
					It’s important as a user to be able to understand functionality of an application quickly without much effort. With this in mind, Google Maps was implemented as a navigation system, which allows users to find locations and directions to law
					firms or CLCs on our applications.
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>


				<p>
					After several mock-ups of the user interface, Belle moved on to developing the <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/SCwiOtEvUmZPEdsNTMqH1I/Legal-Services-UI-v2.?node-id=49%3A1097&scaling=scale-down" target="_blank">final prototype</a> of
					the user interface in Figma. The final prototype works as a fully functional display of what the user interface will look like in the finished mobile application, and abides by the same design heuristics and principles.
				</p>

				<h4>Disclaimer and language options</h4>

				<p>
					An important consideration that we have to show in our prototype is that we are not trying to replace important legal resources; if needed the appropriate legal service should always be used. With this in mind, a disclaimer will display
					when the application is launched explaining this to the user. In addition to this, Australia has many different languages so an option to change language is a must in the final application.
				</p>

				<h4>Homepage</h4>

				<p>
					The home page and navigation bar act as the central navigation methods for the application, allowing users to move easily and quickly through the different features of the application.
				</p>

				<h4>Find a lawyer/firm, CLC and maps</h4>

				<p>
					The “Find a CLC” and “Find a Lawyer/Law Firm” function both utilise and implement Google Maps in similar ways.
				</p>

				<h4>VLA</h4>

				<p>
					Victoria Legal Aid has its own homepage, which will branch out to other features.
				</p>

				<h4>VALS</h4>

				<p>
					Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service also operates in a similar fashion.
				</p>

				<h4>Library</h4>

				<p>
					A library of legal resources will also link to various other features of the application, including:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The Plain English repository, where legal resources written without the legal jargon can be found.</li>
					<li>Ask a Lawyer, where users can type in a query to be answered by a lawyer or legal professional.</li>
					<li>Interpreter services</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Staff Login</h4>

				<p>
					The application will also have the ability for staff to access the backend of the application via a staff login page
				</p>

				<h3>What stage of the plan are you up to?</h3>
				<p>
					Goony is now up to the stage where the working user interface needs to be transposed into a working mobile application and developing a working and integrated database for the application. An important part of this particular step is user
					testing. To ensure we are delivering a project that will actually achieve our aim in a user focused and user friendly way is a key part of developing a mobile application. An iterative approach to user testing should be taken when
					developing a program. This is important because if there are any major design issues or functionality issues they can be discovered and fixed quickly without much hassle at all stages of development.
				</p>


				<h3>Dead-ends encountered</h3>
				<p>
					Fortunately during the course of this project, things have been running very smoothly. We’ve encountered no dead-ends thanks to careful planning and proper risks assessment. The closest we’ve come to a dead-end was changing our project at
					the start of this assignment. We were originally planning to create a virtual assistant, but due to the complex nature of the project and our own limited experience and technical-skills we decided to shift project ideas to something more
					technically approachable.
				</p>

				<h3>Decisions made</h3>
				<p>
					We decided following Assignment 2 to change our method of task allocation - from dividing by marks on the rubric to taking a more collaborative approach, and each contributing to every task together. This led us to decide to use the Kanban
					tool to distribute our individual workloads across all of the tasks. On reflection we didn’t really take advantage of the Kanban tool specifically; but we did speak in team meetings about what we should focus and work on before the
					following meeting, and relied on individual team members' initiative to collaboratively contribute to those tasks.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also changed our initial project choice from a virtual assistant to a legal aid app. This decision was made largely due to limitations in our group's technical knowledge and experience, which limited the feasibility of us creating such
					an app as an artifact. We decided to go with the legal aid app because it would give us all an opportunity to cover several aspects of project development, instead of spending the majority of our time trying to learn how to code, which
					might have limited the scope of what we would learn from the assignment.
				</p>
				<p>
					We decided to create the UI prototype exclusively for IOS, in order to save time on creating an android version as well. This was largely for the same reasons as outlined in the previous point - that we wanted to maximise our available time
					on looking at different aspects of the assignment, rather than dedicating time to essentially duplicating one part.
				</p>
				<p>
					A major decision we came to in week 10/11 was how to proceed with our project, given we were ahead of schedule. Our main artifact was intended to be the Figma prototype of the app, but we had nearly finished that, and finished most of the
					report content as well, as of week 11. We discussed with Anthony in our consultation whether we should focus on deepening what we had already chosen to do - i.e. really consolidate the prototype as a high fidelity one with all the features
					we had chosen, and possibly add more - or broaden the scope and include other artifacts such as beginning on a SQLite database, Xamarin coding, etc. We ended up taking somewhat of a middle approach, in which we incorporated additional
					elements (including a relational database file and entity relationship diagram), but kept our primary focus on finishing the prototype, updating our forked github page with new content, and planning out our group video presentation (which
					we had somewhat forgotten about).
				</p>

				<h3>Changes that have been made to the project plan</h3>
				<p>
					Throughout the project there haven’t been too many changes to the project plan. The main change to the plan that Goony decided to implement, apart from the obvious of changing project ideas which was mentioned previously, was to complete a
					mock-up database and populate it with some sample data as well as a user interface prototype. The decision to mock-up a database as well came at the last minute after the consultation with Anthony. Goony committed to doing the database
					mock-up because it seemed like the project artefact was going to be completed with a couple of weeks left in the intended timeframe, which gave us a little bit more time to deliver a more complete vision of the project.
				</p>

				<h3>Handover plan</h3>
				<p>
					Goony is currently up to the stage of usability testing of our user interface design. This is an important thing to mention because it’s what will need to be done straight after the handover. Once this has been completed and user feedback
					has been successfully integrated into the prototype, the next step is to create a working SQLite database that will be influenced by Tom’s mock-up design of the database and contain more than just sample data.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next step in the plan is to create a working mobile application using Xamarin. This will take the most time so the most amount of time should be spent on developing the actual working iOS application. After this, The newly created
					database will need to be integrated into the application. Finally and with time permitting, a final run of usability testing should be conducted to ensure that our intended users and demographic find the legal aid application intuitive and
					effective to use.
				</p>

				<hr>

				<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>

				<p>
					In line with our reflection on assignment 2, our team has chosen not to assign particular roles to each member, but instead to each participate in every facet of assignment 3. It is hoped that this will ensure that we each have a more
					holistic and rounded appreciation of (and contribution to) the project, rather than the more compartmentalised approach we took previously. That being said, it is still important to identify and understand the specific roles and
					responsibilities of the project, even if more than one of us are performing them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whereas the ‘skills and jobs’ section of this assignment outlines the roles that we anticipate we would need to incorporate down the track; this section is less about defining what type of professionals we would need to hypothetically
					employ, and more about describing the types of tasks that we as a group have performed. This comes with the obvious caveat that none of us are currently IT professionals (though not all of the roles described are exclusively IT-related).
				</p>
				<h4>Project Manager</h4>
				<p>
					We have each contributed to the management of the project, insofar as setting specific goals and timeframes within which to reach them, and assigning individual responsibilities. Similarly, we have all played a role in coordination and
					participated in robust communication and reflection of where the group as a whole is at, including discussions on accountability.
				</p>
				<h4>User Interface Designer</h4>
				<p>
					Again, given that our project is a smartphone app, we have been conscious throughout the process that our app’s UI needs to be user-friendly, intuitive, and accessible. This has meant the collaborative undertaking of tasks such as
					wireframing, prototyping and general discussions over what we intend our app to look like and how we want it to function (this has included taking into account such things as Neilson’s Heuristics and design principles and laws).
				</p>
				<h4>Content Researcher and Writer</h4>
				<p>
					The technical requirements of our app are not the ends of our project, but the means. As our aim describes, the objective is to have a product that aggregates legal services throughout Victoria in order to improve the accessibility of such
					information to disadvantaged demographics. This has required detailed research into what is already available, but also in terms of finding and critically analysing resources related to Victorian legal aid, and legal help resources in
					general, in order to determine what we want to include in our app.
				</p>
				<h4>Database Architect</h4>
				<p>
					This was more of an adjunct role in order to demonstrate an example of what type of database we would use in the app. A UML diagram was first designed, then a schema obtained from it, which was turned into a relational database using SQLite
					(the more common DBMS for smartphone apps given its portability). Obviously with this database being illustrative rather than functional, moving forward we would need to scrape a lot more data to input, as well as incorporating the database
					within the app software.
				</p>

				<hr>

				<h2 id="scopeandlimits">Scope and Limits</h2>
				<p>
					Given that none of our group have experience in designing or creating mobile applications, we have purposely limited our initial scope to creating a prototype which mimics the functionality of what we want our app to do, without actually
					being programmed to do so. By doing this, we are able to focus on the features that we want to include, and ensure that the app serves the purpose it was intended for. This means that, in this initial phase of our project, we only need to
					come up with example templates for each feature, such as a screenshot of the google maps function, or an example of a Law Firm page or Community Legal Centre directory. By taking this approach, and limiting our scope to a snapshot of what
					the app will be, rather than actually learning how to program it (which would take up most of the remaining time in the semester), we will be able to use our time more productively and get the most out of this assignment.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, by having a prototype screenshot of the Law Firm Directory, we are able to easily show how that feature will function without having to create and populate a database of law firms and program that into the app (although we did
					create a sample database to illustrate this). Likewise, we can show how a user can find legal advice in different languages without actually having to create a fully functioning app, or needing to find the correct translations of all the
					information we intend to include. Finally, Figma allows us to show how the different screens on our app will interact with one another without us having to actually learn the programming skills needed to do it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, this scope takes into account the fact that we only have five weeks to complete assignment 3; the additional 10 hypothetical weeks include starting to learn some of the requisite programming skills for the actual app development,
					as well as incorporating other existing technologies and platforms that we intend to use, such as google maps and SQLite, into our design.
				</p>

				<hr>

				<h2 id="toolsandtechnologies">Tools and Technologies</h2>
				<p>The tools and technologies that Goony will be using for this project are: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Kanban - For goal setting</li>
					<li>Lucidcharts - Drafting the app features, wireframing, creating an ER diagram for database</li>
					<li>Figma - To design a working UI</li>
					<li>Xamarin - To create the working application for iOS</li>
					<li>SQLite - To build the legal database in</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Versions</h4>

				<p>
					Throughout the project Goony will be using many different tools and technologies in order to complete our legal aid mobile application. The latest version of Kanban Tool can be accessed through Microsoft Teams Which is accessible through
					the 2019 version of Office 365. Xamarin is downloaded through version 16.7 of Visual Studio 2019. SQLite would be the best choice for development on a mobile application. The newest version of SQLite would be best in this context, which is
					SQLite version 3.33.0.
				</p>

				<h4>Licenses</h4>

				<p>
					In terms of licenses for the tools and technologies, the only open source program that we are going to use for this project is SQLite which is a free download for any users and Visual Studio 2019 version 16.7 has a free community download.
					All other programs that Goony is using for the development of this application require a license to be used effectively. Figma, Lucidcharts and Microsoft Teams all have free versions of the software that can be used for development, but
					have very limited collaboration potential. These three programs will be used to advantage group collaboration if the licenses are purchased. Microsoft Team will need at least a basic Office 365 subscription in order to record online
					meetings which is $6.90 a month. Lucidcharts and Figma will require the Team and the Professional subscriptions which are $13 and $12 a month respectively. It’s important to point out that because the members of Goony are currently enrolled
					in a university, we can access all the licenses for these tools and technologies as part of university enrollment with our education accounts.
				</p>

				<h4>Team Member's experiences in chosen tools and technologies</h4>
				<p>
					<b>Tom</b> - Has used SQLite and LucidChart briefly in another subject this year, but nothing besides that.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Belle</b> - no experience with Xamarin and would need to study it, but has been able to use Figma and LucidChart to figure out the UI. Has used SQLite for another subject, but is not proficient with it.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Andrew</b> - Has not used any programs before but has watched tutorials and understands the main concepts of what it is used for and how it benefits the teams’ idea. SQLite was new to Andrew but is interested in learning more and gaining
					experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Campbell</b> - Has used Lucidchart a couple of times before and has tested out Figma but has never used Kanban or Xamarin. Has used SQLite for a different subject but isn’t completey comfortable with it.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Tung</b> - Lucidchart briefly to create UML diagrams and study entity-relations for another subject. Figma to create a prototype application to explore and apply UCD elements and understand UX theories in another subject. SQLite to
					create queries and explore databases for another subject. Has yet to use Kanban or Xamarin.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Ben</b> - Has used other programs such as Trello for task management and goal setting in previous projects but have never used Kanban Tool before. Lucidchart has been used to create UML diagrams in a Practical Database Concepts course.
					In addition to Lucidcharts, SQLite has been used in this same subject to create databases and write queries. Ben has used Figma before in User Centered Design to create user interface wireframes. Finally, Ben has never used Xamarin before
					so he would have to learn how to code using Xamarin but has had some experience in coding before this subject but is certainly not an expert.
				</p>

				<hr>
				<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
				<p>
					The purpose of building a prototype using Figma is twofold: it enables us to have somewhat of an idea of what the app will look and function like, but it also allows us to test and troubleshoot any issues that come up - whether
					unanticipated or just something we have flagged to look at. Obviously this type of testing is not technical, but it is a good type of testing to do in the initial stages of the project, because it allows us to design the functionality of
					the app before we proceed to the programming stage, and to iron out any issues we find before we start coding and they become harder to fix
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the course of the project, we aim to continue testing in different ways during different stages. For example, once we have a working prototype, we can undertake an analysis of the app’s usability using <a
						href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank">Neilson’s usability heuristics</a> or comparisons with other design principles and methods. The results (i.e the severity of any issues we encounter) will
					inform decisions on how best to proceed - for example, whether we jettison some functions of the app, change their functionality, or merely change or simplify the aesthetic.
				</p>

				<span class="image right"><img src="images/NeilsonGraph.gif" alt="Neilson's User Advice"></span>

				<p>
					As for user testing, we will again heed <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/" target="_blank">Neilson’s advice</a> and test the app with five users, which will provide us with sufficient feedback
					to improve our design. This will be repeated twice more, giving a total of 15 user tests, which will allow us to iteratively diagnose problems with, and improve the design of our app. The following graph illustrates why the number 15 has
					been chosen. We will be able to find our users using a survey with screener questions, so as to ensure we will be getting data from our target demographic (i.e. those people who are in need of legal advice/information but who are not sure
					how or where to get it, generally from disadvantaged backgrounds).

				<h2 id="risks">Risks</h2>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					It’s important when developing a concept / planning a project to consider the risks involved. When it comes to our project we’ve identified 3 main areas that risks come from: development risks during production, usability risks when users
					interact with our product and designs and also legal risks and liabilities with the information we provide. Identifying risks ahead of time and planning for them early allows us to be cautious and mindful, and actively mitigate or avoid
					potential problems completely.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Be-all and end-all solution - </b>The primary risk here is the fear that information provided here (particularly in the repository) will be taken as formal legal advice. There is a big risk that people will use the application as a
					direct source of information and not seek further legal advice from lawyers. The application is meant to be a collection of resources for users to seek advice and information required to their individual circumstances.</p>
				<p>
					A disclaimer may be needed that it is meant to be informative rather than prescriptive, and to use that information to better inform decisions. Plus, the app does facilitate ways to connect people to the right places. One way of doing this
					is presenting the disclaimer as the user launches the app to inform and clarify users that the application is not to be used as a direct source of information but here to help users find the appropriate legal representation and legal
					advice.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Accuracy of information - </b>The content of our application is legal based and the law objective and precise we run the risk of mis-information and presenting the wrong information to users. It would also be important to point out the
					Law is always changing and getting updates.This can be very detrimental to potential users and make us liable by providing the wrong information. The goal behind this project is to provide everyone with the resources they need to act
					accordingly within the law and seek the proper help for their individual circumstances. Providing wrong information would go completely against our main goal.It would also be important to point out the Law is always changing and getting
					updates. The application would require constant updating and maintenance to keep the information relevant and make sure users are getting the correct information.</p>
				<p>
					To get around this we need to seek advice and consult with legal professionals to make sure our information is accurate and credible. We could even partner-up with a few law firms to be represented on our application and share their firm’s
					details such as hours and available layers and their contact details for legal advice. And the application itself would require constant updating and maintenance to keep the information relevant and make sure users are getting the correct
					information.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Software difficulties - </b>As our team is composed of beginners to programming and coding, there is a big risk of having difficulties learning the appropriate software for mobile application development. We’ve looked into Xamarin which
					is an open-source platform for building modern and performant applications for iOS, Android, and Windows with .NET.</p>
				<p>
					Although, Xamarin does have a lot of beginner tutorials out there to help us use the program which should help us get over this hurdle. But once again we may run into potential problems later when using the platform.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>User limitations - </b>To make the application available to a wide range of users it is expected that we develop an application compatible for iOS and Android platforms. It’s a risk we take when developing and devoting all our time and
					resources into one platform and falling short when working on the other, that there will be compatibility issues and a potentially sub-par, second application.</p>
				<p>
					Doing appropriate research into both platforms in regards to iOS and Android is within our best interest to understand the pros and cons of both operating systems, and what both of them can and can’t do. This can prevent us from making
					design and programming decisions that can’t be smoothly replicated from one to the other.
				</p>

				<hr>

				<h2 id="groupprocesses">Group Processes & Communications</h2>
				<p>The main means of communication for our group will be Microsoft Teams with the report content being done through a file in a shared Google Drive folder. It is expected that the members of Goony all attend twice-weekly face-to-face meetings
					that are scheduled and recorded through the Microsoft Teams platform. In the event that a team member does not come to the scheduled meetings, they will be contacted through Microsoft Teams with the inbuilt tagging system, if they don’t
					respond to that, they will be emailed. Finally, if all forms of communication do not yield a response, Anthony will be contacted for further support and action.</p>

				<hr>
				<h2 id="skillsandjobs">Skills and jobs</h2>
				<p> <b>In this section, the group have discussed the main roles we would recruit if the project was funded for an additional 6 months. </b> </p>

				<p> <b>IT Project Manager -</b> If we were to be given a larger amount of resources for our project idea, it would be reasonable to have an IT
					professional oversee the operations. They will assist us in completing tasks we find too difficult and ensure that the program is safe and
					secure. If we are obtaining personal information, the IT professional will assist in securing this information.<br>
					<br> A further funding of 6 months could also potentially lead to a website based system allowing for more users. Although we should have a
					good guideline of what to expect (from the application), it is expected that developing a website for this will not be easy. When developing
					a fully functional website, we must also consider desktop and mobile friendly versions as well as a link to the application.
					<br> The manager will also have skills and experience that will open up new ideas for the project. Although not a professional in the legal
					department, we expect that the ideas will relate to the functionality of our application and find ways to improve it by making it simpler,
					neater and more user friendly. We also expect that an IT project manager will encourage their own personal changes to our project allowing
					for innovative adaptations. </br> </p>

				<p> <b>Professional Legal Adviser -</b> When further developing a large scale project, our main target remains as Victorians. However, we
					must consider the legal complications we may encounter as our user base grows. As the group has limited legal knowledge, a professional
					could assist with major issues. <br>
					<br>To expand our project, it would be ideal to have a professional legal adviser, not only for legal issues with our project, but to also
					present ideas as this is their field of expertise. A legal professional will likely have newer ideas that we would not have thought of and
					therefore attract more users. To have more professional assistance would benefit the project idea and our development as we do not plan to
					limit our design to what it is, we want to encourage continuous change to be the best.
					<br>A professional legal adviser would allow us to grow our plan for expansion by offering information that cannot merely be researched,
					rather comes with experience. Therefore, having a professional contributing to our project idea allows us to have greater accuracy of
					information by using their knowledge of resources and allows for continuous legal updates to be provided at a sufficient time. </br> </p>

				<p> <b>UX Designer -</b> To work with potential user groups and test the functionality of the application and how effective the features
					being implemented are, based on user needs and requirements. Understanding what users expect and how they will use the application is very
					important to the user experience. It’s one thing to have all the necessary features but if they aren’t implemented the right way or if the
					application is difficult to use then users aren’t going to enjoy the application and stick around. There is a big risk the application
					doesn’t take off as a result. <br>
					<br> Strong communication and team-work abilities are very important as a ux-designer as it requires the individual to convey and express
					UX design ideas and concepts to team-members in a way they can understand. If research-surveys and user-research/focus-groups are conducted
					the ux-designer is required to have strong communication skills and leadership skills to get the right information across and guide and direct
					ideas in focus groups. </br>
				<p>

				<p> <b>Software/Mobile App Developer -</b> Taking into consideration that we’ve started this project as a group of uni-students with no real
					experience in software or mobile application development. It is within our interest to hire a specialist in software/mobile app-development
					to execute our ideas and vision. Doing so will allow us to produce this project a lot quicker and produce something that runs smoothly.<br>
					<br> The app-developer would be required to demonstrate adequate communications skills to understand the outcome of the project when
					discussing ideas with the team and the flexibility to adapt the project as needed. Time management is very important especially when working
					as part of a team where completion of work is necessary for other members to progress. For example, the UX designer might need a certain part
					of the application up and running for testing with a scheduled focus group, it is expected of the app-developer to communicate progress
					and meet deadlines.<br>
					<br> Specialist knowledge with Xamarin and C# is required as the project is working with this platform and that goes hand-in-hand with knowledge
					of developing for iOS and Android platforms. The application will have a legal repository/database for users to access which would require the
					add-developer to have experience using SQLite to create and manage a database. </br>
