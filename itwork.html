								Kohen Grogan is the Founder and Managing Director of the <a href="https://www.yappy.com.au/">Yappy Group</a>, a social media marketing company based in Perth, Western Australia. After completing a Bachelor of Communications in 2009, he worked briefly as an online reputation management and social media strategy consultant. During this period, he was constantly asked by clients about what the return on investment was for social media advertising. From their clear unfamiliarity with this emerging market, he saw an opportunity to fill a niche.
							</p>
							<p>
								Thus, in March 2012, he quit his job and created Yappy in his garage; his $2,000 savings constituting the budget <a href="https://alumniprofiles.ecu.edu.au/4282004-kohen-grogan">(Edith Cowan University, 2018)</a>. His aim was to create a platform that would be able to ‘accurately measure the effectiveness of clients’ social media marketing’ <a href="https://www.40under40.com.au/Winner/Kohen-Grogan#:~:text=Kohen%20Grogan%20founded%20Yappy%20Group,including%20Thermomix%2C%20Finbar%20and%20McDonald's">(40under40, 2016)</a>. The platform he created allows ‘users to set up and manage campaigns, harvest databases and track conversions from content across any platform on the social web’ <a href="https://thewest.com.au/business/finance/software-success-makes-yappy-talk-of-town-ng-ya-228122">(Hatch, 2015)</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Within the space of a few months, Yappy had moved from the garage to a St George’s Terrace office in the Perth CBD, and by 2020 it had become a multi-million dollar business that employed over 15 people and counted among its clients multinational companies such as McDonalds, Finbar and Thermomix.

								Kohen was kind enough to speak with us about his experiences, and offered some valuable insights into the tech sector.

								<b>
								Q: 	Good afternoon and many thanks for giving up your time to be interviewed. To begin, could you please tell us a bit about what you and your company do?
							</b>
								<br>
								<blockquote>A: 	Yeah, no worries. I work in the digital space, essentially using big data and social intelligence to figure out what to serve to people in order to get them to take an action.
								<br><br>Yappy started eight years ago to solve return on investment in social media, so we're one of the very early players in that space. We profitably scale e-commerce businesses, and we're the best in the Asia-Pacific with direct response with all of Facebook's platforms. We're in a pretty unique spot because we've got three-way partnerships between us, the platforms and online and transactional data companies, which means we can get highly granular with who we're targeting.</blockquote>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>
								Q: 	Sounds interesting, and what is your role in that process?
							</b>
							<br>
								<blockquote>A: 	I’m the founder and managing director, so my role is largely focused the strategy and analytics side of things, as well as the general management of the business.</blockquote>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>
								Q: 	Could you give a brief synopsis of the industry that you and your company operate within?
							</b>
								<br>
								<blockquote>A: 	Yeah sure, so there are a couple of industries that we span. I guess digital marketing and analytics would probably be the bucket that we’d be thrown in, and more specifically in the social media space.
								<br><br>E-commerce is at the core of what we do. It's an area that is growing exponentially, and there are so many new markets that are opening up. This opens up opportunities for companies that can be based anywhere in the world, and our role is to help them scale their business to take advantage.</blockquote>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>
								Q:	Who are the different types of colleagues and stakeholders that you interact with in your daily work, and what are their roles?
							</b>
								<br>
								<blockquote>A:	So there’s the people in strategy, the people in content and creative, the people in campaign management and analytics, developers, etc. There’s a whole range really.</blockquote>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>
								Q:	And what about your interactions with clients and investors and those types of people? How savvy are they with knowing exactly what the IT side of things entails?
							</b>
								<br>
								<blockquote>A:	I interact with a board of directors, and investors as well, and their IT knowledge would be somewhat limited I’d say. It generally comes down to explaining things in basic terms, and there’s a whole array of different IT components to the business. There’s the infrastructure piece – things like making sure we’ve got fast enough internet with, say, fibre to the node. There’s the background analytics piece to make sure that we’re measuring and delivering objectives for clients, but also being able to figure out specifically what works for different cohorts of people. And then there’s also just the IT mix of software and programs and other technical things that we use to run the business day-to-day. On that point, I think COVID has certainly changed some elements of that, in particular how we communicate with stakeholders, including clients, but also with our staff as well. We’ve become a lot more digitally-focused in that respect, with communication through things like Zoom increasingly common. It’s meant that we’ve had to put much more structured programs in place for project management and things like that, so that we can properly see what people are doing and make sure that we achieve outcomes while we’re unable to collaborate physically in offices. So that’s been interesting.</blockquote>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>
								Q:	Your background is in PR and business, what kind of IT technologies do you consider to be most valuable for businesses, and what trends do you think are most important or interesting moving forward?
							</b>
								<br>
								<blockquote>A:	There are some real core technologies that are trending that are going to be really important. One of them is artificial intelligence, and particularly its impact in terms of being able to analyse and predict things. AI is going to have a whole heap of different impacts on a wide range of businesses from a disruption point of view. Another key trend is blockchain and being able to run smart contracts and things like that so that they are seamless – it will almost be an experience that involves no human element at all! Another core technology trend revolves around the robotics and automation side of things. So that relates to automating processes within a business, but also automating day-to-day activities that a human would traditionally do. They’re probably the three main ones.
								<br><br>
								The companies that are really winning at the moment are companies that have their own platforms, because when you’ve got your own tech platform – and if you’ve got enough data and data analytics capacity (that’s probably another key trend) – it can be a very, very powerful tool because of the things we’ve just discussed, like machine learning and AI. A lot of the businesses that we’re interacting with are starting to see that this side of things is becoming more important – many of them have a lot of data, but they’re unsure with what to do with it and in some cases can’t make sense of it. Often they go down the rabbit hole with the wrong assumptions and draw the wrong conclusions because they’re focusing on the wrong data, or looking at the right data but in the wrong way.
								<br><br>
								There’s also a real trend towards personalisation. Everyone wants an experience that is unique for them and tailored to them. You’ll notice with things like online banking that you can tailor your own dashboard and preferences, to mention a basic example. There’s definitely a trend in which people want that unique experience tailored just to them, and that comes from communication and making sure that people are getting communicated to in way that will resonate with them and add value. It also comes from how people interact with IT and technology, so making sure that there is a tailored approach is becoming more important for businesses.</blockquote>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>
								Q:	In terms of your own role, what aspects do you find most challenging, and what do you spend most of your time on?
							</b>
								<br>
								<blockquote>A:	I would say that one of the key challenges would be that there are so many solutions that are out there from an IT perspective, and so a lot of time needs to be spent honing in and making sure that you pick the right kinds of solutions for your needs. It can be quite fragmented with the number of platforms out there that can help with your IT needs, but there is rarely, if ever, a ready-made solution for your exact needs. It comes back to the personalisation issue that I was talking about before, and how you can implement the best IT solutions for your business and its day-to-day workings. There is a lot of ensuring that API’s (application programming interface) and other things can communicate so that you can get the outcomes that you want. That can be challenging and can take up a lot of time.</blockquote>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>
								Q:	Can you share an example of the work that you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?
							</b>
								<br>
								<blockquote>A:	A good example I guess is the whole process of transforming something from a concept, having it designed and implemented so it is ready for market, and then analysing the results and data, and putting that in a format that’s right for the end user (in our case the client). It’s a very broad example, but that process holds true for almost any client that we work with.</blockquote>
